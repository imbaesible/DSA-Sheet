//Q8 (287) Find the Duplicate Number

// Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
// There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
// You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

// Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
// Output: 2

// Approach 1; Sort the array

// Firstly sort the array using merge sort or inbuilt sort function then we'll traverse through array and look for that one duplicate number.

int findDuplicate(vector < int > & arr) {
  int n = arr.size();
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
}

//Time Complexity : O(N logN)
//Space Complexity : O(1)



//Approach 2: using Hashing

// We'll create a Frequency array of size (N - 1) from the main array and then you know what to do...but

int findDuplicate(vector < int > & arr) {
  int n = arr.size();
  int freq[n + 1] = {
    0
  };
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (freq[arr[i]] == 0) {
      freq[arr[i]] += 1;
    } else {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

//Space Comlexity : O(N)
//Time Complexity : O(N)



//Approach 3 : using fast and slow pointer approach

// Intuition: Since there is a duplicate number, we can always say that cycle will be formed.

// The slow pointer moves by one step and the fast pointer moves by 2 steps and there exists a cycle so the first collision is bound to happen.

// Letâ€™s assume the distance between the first element and the first collision is a. So slow pointer has traveled a distance while fast(since moving 2 steps at a time) has traveled 2a distance. For slow and a fast pointer to collide 2a-a=a should be multiple of the length of cycle, Now we place a fast pointer to start. Assume the distance between the start and duplicate to be x. So now the distance between slow and duplicate shows also be x, as seen from the diagram, and so now fast and slow pointer both should move by one step.

int findDuplicate(vector < int > & nums) {
  int slow = nums[0];
  int fast = nums[0];
  do {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[nums[fast]];
  } while (slow != fast);
  fast = nums[0];
  while (slow != fast) {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[fast];
  }
  return slow;
}


//Time Complexity : O(N)
//Space Complexity : O(1)
